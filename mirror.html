				<h2>PROBLEM&#58;</h2>
					<p class="Pdescription">Create an installation in correspondence with its 
					environment. </p>
				<h2>SOLUTION&#58;</h2>
					<p class="Pdescription">
					Society has lost its ability to be observant in our developing world. 
					As we rush from one place to the next, people are constantly talking 
					on the phone, texting, and catching up on social media. Basically 
					doing everything except observing and relating with the people 
					and environment surrounding them. 
					<br><br>
					The goal of this installation is to bring amusement to the few who 
					are aware and hopefully catch the attention of those who have drifted 
					into cyberspace. Even if a person is caught up looking at their phone, 
					there is still potential for the viewerâ€™s downward glance to be drawn 
					in by the mirror on the ground.
					<br><br>
					This piece intended to make people more aware of their surroundings by placing 
					subtle inconsistencies in their environment. Starting from the ground up &#040;this caught many people glancing down at their phones&#041;.
					And working from the ceiling down &#040;for those walking with their head held high&#041;. Click
