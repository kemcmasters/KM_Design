				<h1 class="Ptitle">BUSY BEE PAPER COMPANY</h1>
				<img class="Pline">
				<h2>PROBLEM&#58;</h2>
					<p class="Pdescription">In need of an innovative paper promo that pushes the boundaries.
					Keep in mind that paper promotion pieces can be quite extravagant so do not limit ideas
					based on how expensive this piece would be to produce.  </p>
				<h2>SOLUTION&#58;</h2>
					<p class="Pdescription"> Plantable paper was the focus of this promotional piece. The book
					cover is a durable piece that contains all of the vital information such as the company name, 
					contact, and the paper products being promoted. The inside gives the client samples of different 
					papers with all of the specs on the back. It also informs the client about the business on the front of 
					the papers. The binding is a post binding so the client can take out the samples that are sewn 
					together in order to sow their own little plot of garden after they are done reading the 
					given information.  </p>
