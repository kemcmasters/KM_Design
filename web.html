				<h2>PROBLEM&#58;</h2>
					<p class="Pdescription">Develop a website in collaboration with a partner. 
					Each person will relay the same content, although, the style and layout of each 
					person's site will be completed individually. </p>
					
				<h2>SOLUTION&#58;</h2>
					<p class="Pdescription"> The foundation of our site circulated around a play on words:  
					Hand Skills vs. Hands Kill. That slight change in where you put the space between the words 
					created two very important categories for designers to take into consideration while
					pursuing the design process. First, Hands Kill was broken down into your audience, the
					environment, and the self since these are all affected by the message we send through our design.
					Second, Hand Skills focused on how print, web design, and packaging can all
					be improved by innovative, thoughtful, and deliberate design choices. Each category is not
					only explained but also links to examples of design that are demonstrating these considerations.
					Click <a href="http://kemcmasters.iweb.bsu.edu/handskills/" class="descriptionlink" target="blank">
					here</a> to check out the sight for yourself!   </p>
