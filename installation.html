				<h2>PROBLEM&#58;</h2>
					<p class="Pdescription">Create a thought provoking installation that will 
					allow the viewers to interact and contribute to the piece. </p>
				<h2>SOLUTION&#58;</h2>
					<p class="Pdescription">From the moment we are brought into this world, 
					there is an excessive list of concrete factors that will affect our 
					lives. The majority of factors we have no control over. Our family, 
					gender, social norms, and the weather show just a snip-it of our decided 
					environment, an environment that has the ability to manufacture and mold 
					each individual into the person they are today.
					<br><br>
					The words written on the glass of the installation are all related to 
					different aspects of people&#39;s environment or factors that are out of 
					their control. Phrases such as &ldquo;parenting” or &ldquo;culture” are situations t
					hat seem out of our hands, are laser cut into the glass or plexi, while 
					&ldquo;friends&rdquo; or &ldquo;location&rdquo; are inscribed in dry erase marker because we have 
					the ability to change those things if we desire to. These distinctions 
					are made to show that even though you always have a choice on how you 
					allow your environment to affect you, some factors pose as greater 
					challenges than others. 
					<br><br>
					Lastly the mirrors are a reference to the double 
					consciousness that exists in the world. As we compare ourselves to people 
					through outlets such as social media, we are constantly &ldquo;looking at 
					one&#039;s self through the eyes of others,&rdquo; as W.E.B. DeBois states. 
					We are in conflict between who your environment raised you to be 
					verses who you aspire to be. Dry erase markers were left out with the 
					installation to allow people to interact with the installation and add 
					their own comments and words to the glass panes.</p>
