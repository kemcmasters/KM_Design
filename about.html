				<h1 class="large"> Meet Kelly </h1>
				<p> Kelly finds interactions with people to be one of the most exhilarating 
				facets of life. She exists as the bond between observation and interaction, 
				always scanning her environment for unseen details and striving to highlight 
				the beauty that may have been previously overlooked. Through this observation, 
				she becomes connected to her environment and strangers that surround her. 
				While Kelly is a photographer and traveler at heart&#59; she equally enjoys immersing 
				herself in the design world with a sincere appreciation for collaboration. 
				Researching past design endeavors inspires her to find a new, unspoken for, 
				approach for her projects. Kelly has a growing fascination with bookmaking, 
				plantable paper, installation arts, and her interests only expand with her 
				insatiable curiosity. </p>
				<h1> What Inspires Kelly&#63; </h1>
				<p>bike rides, strangers, the smell of rain, rooftop views, lightning storms, 
				soulful singing, infinite moments, saturated colors, watching airplanes at 
				the landing strip, sporadic dancing, wildflowers in alleys  </p>
